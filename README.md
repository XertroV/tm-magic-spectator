# Magic Spectate

The "magic spectate" feature from Dips++ as an independent plugin.

## Requires MLHook! You *must* install MLHook too.

## To spectate ghosts you will need Ghosts++ installed.

This plugin allows you to spectate players and ghosts in online servers without being in spectator mode (so using this plugin won't kill your run).

Useful for RPGs or spectating ghosts in TA servers.
(Note: ghosts are sync'd to your current race time, so you will need to respawn to restart the ghost.)
